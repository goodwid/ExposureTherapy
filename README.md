(Increasingly Graphic Visual Exposure)

#### Purpose:
The purpose of Conquer It! is to help people with arachnophobia to engage in exposure therapy to lessen or even conquer their phobia.

#### Benefits:
Our intended user utilizes our application to address what in many cases is a debilitating fear that can interfere with his/her daily life. The benefits include lower anxiety when presented with situations involving spiders and increased confidence in the user’s ability to take control of his/her own mental and emotional wellbeing. Furthermore, Conquer It! offers access to a valuable tool to address arachnophobia without the expense of psychotherapy. Our app will appeal to users, perhaps more than similar apps that may be available, because it will have been designed by a group of developers that includes more than one sufferer of arachnophobia. Ergo our app's approach will be uniquely compassionate and empathetic.

#### User stories:
* As a user I want a way to address my arachnophobia without the high cost and time commitment of seeing a therapist.
* As a user I want an app that let's me control my progressive exposure to discomfiting images so that I am not traumatized by a level of exposure I wasn't prepared for.
* As a user I want an app that is intuitive and simple to use.
* As a user I want a way to quickly halt the exposure exercises when my anxiety level becomes unmanageable.
* As a user I want an app that includes a visual representation of my progress through the exposure program.

#### Developer stories:
* As developers we want to build an app whose structure lends itself to expansion to include exercises for people suffering from other types of phobias. Such an expansion would include an option on the Get Started page for the user to select from a list of phobias, each of which directs the user to a different set of exercises.
* As developers we want to create an app that makes the user feel encouraged and not pressured to advance through the different exposure levels.
* As developers we want to create an app that feels personal by consistently using the user's name in output messages.
